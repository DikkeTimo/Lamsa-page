            Inspired by old recipes from the Syrian Golan Mountains, where people of the
            region used mountain honey as the main ingredient in their skincare regime to
            maintain a youthful and clear complexion.

            This recipe originated in the region of Golan, where locals once produced
            their own skin care creams and ointments using pure ingredients they collected
            from the mountains. Because many of these recipes have healing and nourishing
            properties the knowledge has been passed down through generations between
            family members and households. Such was the case with my father, Khalaf
            Mustafa, an agricultural engineer from the Golan region. Growing up I remember
            him creating his own skincare products for the family members with specific
            concerns. Up until recently, I never gave it much thought... However, after
            relocating to the Netherlands I observed how drastically different weather
            conditions began to negatively impact my skin. For the first time in my life
            my skin became dry and lifeless due to the cold. After conversing with
            different groups of people, I realized I was not the only one with the same
            skin concerns. So I finally decided to turn to my father for an advice. Basing
            his knowledge on the medicinal plants he introduced me to a simple yet
            effective cream recipe that was supposed to help protect and hydrate my skin.
            Under his clear guidance, I developed my first batch of homemade cream. And
            the results exceeded my expectations! Moving to the present day, I-Qusai
            Mustafa took it as a goal to carry on the old traditions of cream making and
            share long-proven recipes with the rest of the world. After months of
            extensive research, a new formula has been developed that not only adheres to
            the high market standards but also provides skin benefits without the use of
            harmful and artificial ingredients.
